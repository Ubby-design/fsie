In your 90-day FSIE roadmap, the ideal point to start AIOps is after the foundational Linux, networking, security, and core DevOps practices are well established, because AIOps assumes you understand:

Linux systems and user/security management

Networking and firewalls

Observability, logging, and monitoring

Automation (Ansible, Terraform, scripts)

CI/CD and container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)

Recommended Start Point for AIOps

Phase: Phase 3 – Monitoring, Reliability, and Automation Layer

Days: ~Day 40–45 onwards

Why: By this point, you have:

Core Linux & networking (Days 1–10)

Security & user management (Days 11–20)

Containers, CI/CD, and orchestration basics (Days 21–35)

Basic observability & monitoring setup (Days 36–40)

Once these are solid, AIOps can be layered on top, because it uses the metrics, logs, alerts, and automation scripts you already have to implement:

Predictive monitoring & anomaly detection

Automated remediation & failure injection

Intelligent event correlation

Performance optimization

Quick mapping:

FSIE Phase	Focus	AIOps Readiness
Phase 1 (Days 1–20)	Linux, Users, Networking, Security	Foundation
Phase 2 (Days 21–40)	Containers, CI/CD, Monitoring	Pre-AIOps layer
Phase 3 (Days 41–60)	Observability, Logging, Reliability	Start AIOps Labs here
Phase 4 (Days 61–90)	Hybrid Cloud, DevSecOps, FinOps	Integrate advanced AIOps into hybrid/cloud
