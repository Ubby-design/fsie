You can start Hybrid Architecture Mastery after you have a strong foundation in both core on-prem systems and cloud fundamentals.

Here’s the structured reasoning:

Prerequisites for Hybrid Architecture Mastery

Before you dive into hybrid architecture, you should be confident in:

Core Linux / On-Prem Systems (Days 1–15)

VM setup, Linux user management, networking, security, SSH

Networking & Firewalls (Days 16–25)

TCP/IP, subnets, routing, NAT, firewall rules, DNS

Containers & Orchestration (Days 26–35)

Docker, Kubernetes, container networking, and RBAC

Cloud Fundamentals (Days 30–40)

AWS or equivalent: VPC, EC2, S3, IAM, Load Balancers

Basic Cloud deployment concepts

CI/CD & Automation (Days 35–45)

Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible

Recommended Start Point

Phase: Phase 4 – Hybrid Architecture & Cloud Integration

Days: ~Day 46–60

Why: By this stage, you:

Have on-prem systems fully configured

Understand containers & CI/CD pipelines

Have cloud basics to integrate with on-prem

Can start designing multi-tier hybrid architectures

Hybrid Architecture Learning Focus

On-Prem → Cloud Integration

VPC peering, VPN, Direct Connect

Cloud load balancers (ALB/NLB) with on-prem web/database tiers

Multi-Tier Application Deployment

Web tier on cloud edge

App tier on hybrid cloud

Database tier on on-prem

Networking & Security for Hybrid

Firewalls, routing, NAT, security groups

Zero-trust segmentation

Monitoring & Reliability Across Hybrid

Centralized logging (ELK / Splunk / CloudWatch)

AIOps integration for hybrid

Portfolio Artifacts

Hybrid topology diagrams

Terraform/VPC/Firewall configs

CI/CD pipelines for hybrid deployment

Failure injection logs for hybrid failover

✅ Summary Table:

FSIE Phase	Days	Focus	Hybrid Architecture Readiness
Phase 1	1–20	Core Linux, Networking, Security	Foundation
Phase 2	21–40	Containers, CI/CD, Cloud Basics	Pre-Hybrid
Phase 3	41–45	Observability, Monitoring, AIOps	Pre-Hybrid
Phase 4	46–60	Hybrid Architecture & Cloud Integration	Start Hybrid Labs


Interesting!


Phase 5	61–90	DevSecOps, FinOps, Full Cloud Migration	Advanced Hybrid Mastery
