Big Picture First (So you see the logic)
Timeline
Day 1–45   → Build foundations + AWS core → SAA ready
Day 45–50  → Sit SAA
Day 50–90  → Hybrid + advanced design → SAP ready
Day 90–100 → Sit SAP

🟢 PART 1 — SAA Coverage (Days 1–45)

SAA tests:

EC2

VPC

IAM

Storage

Load balancing

Autoscaling

HA/DR basics

Monitoring

Cost basics

Notice something?

👉 These are exactly DevOps + Cloud basics
So your roadmap already covers them naturally.

📅 SAA Objective → Lab Mapping
🔹 Days 1–10 — Linux / Systems
Labs:

VM setup

SSH

users/groups

firewall

services

troubleshooting

SAA covers:

✅ EC2 admin fundamentals
✅ OS hardening
✅ SSH access
✅ security mindset
✅ system troubleshooting

Why?

EC2 = Linux server
If Linux weak → SAA weak

Most people skip this.
You won’t.

🔹 Days 11–20 — Networking + Security
Labs:

TCP/IP

subnets

routing

iptables / ufw

DNS

NAT

firewall rules

SAA covers:

✅ VPC design
✅ public/private subnet concepts
✅ routing tables
✅ NAT gateway
✅ security groups vs NACLs
✅ DNS (Route53 logic)

Why?

Half of SAA = networking

This phase alone gives you 40–50% of the exam.

🔹 Days 21–30 — Docker + CI/CD
Labs:

Docker

images

containers

Jenkins

pipelines

deployments

SAA covers:

✅ stateless vs stateful apps
✅ deployment strategies
✅ scaling patterns
✅ immutable infra mindset
✅ blue/green deploy concepts

Why?

SAA LOVES:
“How would you deploy reliably?”

Containers + CI/CD answer everything.

🔹 Days 31–40 — Terraform + AWS Core
Labs:

VPC with Terraform

EC2

S3

RDS

IAM

ALB/NLB

autoscaling

SAA covers:

🔥 THIS IS 70–80% OF THE EXAM 🔥

✅ VPC
✅ Subnets
✅ Internet Gateway
✅ NAT Gateway
✅ ALB
✅ NLB
✅ Auto Scaling Groups
✅ EC2 types
✅ IAM roles/policies
✅ S3 storage classes
✅ RDS multi-AZ

Why?

This is literally the exam blueprint.

You’re not studying.
You’re deploying.

🔹 Days 41–45 — Monitoring
Labs:

Prometheus

Grafana

logs

alerts

SAA covers:

✅ CloudWatch concepts
✅ alarms
✅ metrics
✅ logging
✅ health checks

🎯 RESULT

By Day 45:

You already implemented:

networking

EC2

IAM

ALB

storage

scaling

monitoring

👉 That’s basically the entire SAA.

So:

📌 Take SAA here

Day 45–50

Only do:

practice questions

exam tricks

AWS docs skim

NOT heavy studying.
